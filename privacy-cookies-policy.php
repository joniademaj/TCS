                        A cookie is a small file which asks permission to 
                        be placed on your computer's hard drive. 
                        Once you agree, the file is added and the 
                        cookie helps analyse web traffic or lets you 
                        know when you visit a particular site. Cookies 
                        allow web applications to respond to you as an
                        individual. The web application can tailor its
                        operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by 
                        gathering and remembering information about your 
                        preferences.

                        Cookies have many uses. Let's take a look at some.
                        Membership websites and social media platforms 
                        like Facebook and Twitter use cookies to remember 
                        login credentials. Cookies can also be used to
                        display custom advertisements based on your 
                        previous search history and web browsing 
                        behavior. If you've been browsing the 
                        Internet searching for travel mugs, then 
                        you'll probably see ads for travel mugs on 
                        sites that implement custom banner 
                        advertisements.

                    Social media management is the process of analyzing social media audiences and developing a strategy that’s 
                    tailored to them, creating and distributing content for 
                    social media profiles, monitoring online conversations, 
                    collaborating with influencers, 
                    providing community service, and monitoring, 
                    measuring, and reporting on social media performance and ROI.
                    All these tasks, which were once marginalized by 
                    businesses, have now stepped into the limelight of 
                    companies’ marketing strategies.
                    Why? Because social media provides great money-making 
                    opportunities – on the condition you manage your social channels in an organized, efficient way.
                    The business potential of social networks is immense. Brands can leverage social media platforms to successfully drive their objectives across the marketing funnel, from raising brand awareness to increasing store visits.
                    But to be able to accomplish this, they need efficient social media teams.
                    The more goals you want to achieve through social media marketing, the more people dedicated to this channel you are going to need. This demand will eventually lead to building complex social media team structures.
                    If you are a large brand, you might even have multiple teams in different offices and regions of the world, leveraging different strategies to meet different targets.
